üí´ Multi-Agents Systems
---
- Agents II implements multi-agent systems as they interact within our environment. This project's scope is deploying a population of agents vs single one.

ü¶† Neuro-evolutions
---
 - The evolution of nature inspires computational systems - in machine learning, robotics, industrial design, and art. This implementation deploys the use of evolutionary algorithms to simulate the replication of neural networks.
